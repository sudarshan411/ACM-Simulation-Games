# Final-Game

As discussed in the meet and in the recording, we have a stock based final game that is going to be implemented.

For a prototype, the necessary modules to finish are as follows:

1. A UI for players to log on to and use. (it can be a CLI, but better to get a GUI interface done) (4 players)
2. The game itself, with following submodules:
    1. Stock/Item Listing by the gamemaster
    2. Bidding and splitting the stocks to top two bidders
    3. Dice Roll after every 3 rounds by lowest bidder
3. Anything else that makes sense to put up


---Work in Progress---
