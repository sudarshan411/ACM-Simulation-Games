# Instructions for Phase 2

## Repo Specific Instructions
 - First and foremost, FORK the repo and push all your code to your fork ONLY. **DO NOT** push any code to the main repository.
 - Create a Folder (should be named with "your name") in the Phase-2 folder of the repo, and contain all the code within that.
 - Once you feel that you have done the tasks required, push the code (again to your fork) and open a pull request.
 - If the review has been approved, congrats, your work is pretty much done! :D

## General Instructions

 - All of you have been assigned an issue, it is the same task for all three, but each of you have to come up with your own implementation
 - Try to do all the tasks by yourself, if you need help, ask us (the mentors) or your teammates for it, but DO NOT blindly copy paste code from the net or your teammates
 - Try to do the coding in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab as it makes documenting things a little more pleasing to the eye, but python scripts are also accepted.
 - Document important parts of the code (this applies for every coding task you take up in life :) ) so that it makes it easier to understand what you have done.
